**Files Created:**
```
docs/
└── PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION.md
```

**Current Performance Issues Identified:**

| Component | Issue | Current | Target | Priority |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| MintActionButton | Lines | 532 | < 150 | High |
| MintActionButton handler | Complexity | 63 | < 20 | Critical |
| RedeemActionButton | Lines | 501 | < 150 | High |
| RedeemActionButton | Complexity | 25 | < 20 | High |
| TradingInterface | Lines | 438 | < 150 | High |
| useAccountID | Complexity | 25 | < 20 | Medium |
| useTokenBalances | Lines | 188 | < 150 | Medium |
| PerformancePage | Lines | 510 | < 150 | Medium |

**Optimization Strategies Documented:**

1. **Component Refactoring:**
   - Extract sub-components from large components
   - Extract custom hooks for complex logic
   - Use composition over monolithic components

2. **Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity:**
   - Replace nested conditions with guard clauses
   - Extract validation logic to schemas (Zod)
   - Use early returns
   - Extract error handling functions

3. **React Performance:**
   - Memoization with `memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
   - Code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
   - Virtual scrolling for long lists (`react-window`)

4. **Backend Performance:**
   - Database query optimization (avoid N+1)
   - Caching implementation (already done in 5.2)
   - Batch API requests
   - Query result pagination

5. **Bundle Size:**
   - Tree shaking (import only what's needed)
   - Dynamic imports for large libraries
   - Bundle analyzer for identifying bloat

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Phase 6 - High Priority:** Refactor MintActionButton, RedeemActionButton, TradingInterface
- **Phase 6 - Medium Priority:** Optimize hooks, PerformancePage
- **Future:** Additional component optimization as needed

**Documentation Includes:**
- Before/after code examples
- Performance metrics and targets
- Testing strategies
- Monitoring approaches
- Best practices summary

### ⏸️ 5.4 - Setup Monitoring y Alertas (PENDIENTE)

**Status:** Not Started

**Planned Work:**
- [ ] Integrate Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Configure Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Add business metrics tracking
- [ ] Create dashboards
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical errors

**Dependencies:**
- Requires service refactoring (Phase 2) for clean integration points
- Metrics infrastructure exists (MetricsHandler from 5.1)

**Decision:** DEFER to future phase after Phase 2 is complete

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 5 Completion):
- 5.4 Setup Monitoring can be deferred to post-Phase 2

### Recommended Next Phase:
**Return to Phase 2 to enable integration:**
1. Complete 2.2 - Implement DI (30% → 100%)
2. Complete 2.3 - Repository Pattern for Supabase
3. Complete 2.4 - Refactor Giant Services
4. **Then integrate:**
   - Event sourcing into services
   - Caching into critical services (RateService, TVL, etc.)

### Alternative: Phase 6 - Component Refactoring
If continuing optimization:
1. Refactor MintActionButton (532 lines → < 150)
2. Refactor RedeemActionButton (501 lines → < 150)
3. Refactor TradingInterface (438 lines → < 150)
4. Implement performance optimizations from guide

## 📝 Technical Debt & Decisions

### Strategic Deferrals

**1. Service Integration (Event Sourcing & Caching)**
- **Why:** Services need DI refactoring first (Phase 2.2)
- **Impact:** Infrastructure ready but not in use
- **Timeline:** Integrate in Phase 2 completion

**2. Performance Refactoring Implementation**
- **Why:** Needs dedicated focus and testing
- **Impact:** ESLint warnings persist, build warnings
- **Timeline:** Phase 6 or as needed

**3. Monitoring & Alerts**
- **Why:** Requires stable service layer
- **Impact:** No production monitoring yet
- **Timeline:** Post-Phase 2

### No Breaking Changes
- All new code is additive
- No existing functionality modified
- Safe to deploy alongside current code
- Can be gradually integrated

**Summary:** Phase 5 has successfully delivered production-ready event sourcing and caching infrastructure with comprehensive documentation. The implementation is complete and ready for integration once Phase 2 dependency injection is finished. Performance optimization has been thoroughly documented with a clear implementation roadmap for future work.
